**Input**: "Introduce a `Document` concept that groups multiple `Page`s. The printer should accept a document and generate the final `.prn`/binary output. Documents are only an ordered list of pages and serve as the bridge between the layout engine and the printer driver. Users should be able to choose between a single aggregated `.prn` and per-page output later. No backward compatibility constraints."
